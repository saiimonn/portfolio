                            I am a 19-year-old college student at the University of San Carlos, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
                            <br /> <br />
                            I'm passionate about web development, with a strong inclination towards front-end technologies. I love crafting smooth user interfaces and bringing ideas to life through interactive, accessible, and modern designs.

                            I have experience working with a range of modern technologies that support both front-end and full-stack development. I also have experience in C, which acts as the foundation to my roadmap as a programmer.

                            Beyond technical skills, I value good design and user experience, which guides my attention to detail. Iâ€™m a fast learner, a strong communicator, and enjoy working both independently and in team settings.
